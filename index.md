During my educational career at SNHU I have taken numerous courses. Each course brought greater understanding about information technology in a broad sense. As I have gotten closer to the end of my degree the classes have been much more specific in their content, and have included many aspects of courses that I have taken prior. One class in particular was my CS-360 Mobile Architect and Programming course which had us create an Android application. I chose to create a weight tracking application, which incorporated using buil-in databases to track a users progress, and used the databases incorporated in the application to authenticate the user. To make the application meant designing an application, creating the functionality for each buttton/page using java, and incorporating secure coding practices to each script created. We were tasked with improving our applications and listed below are some examples showing how I met each of the critera mentioned.  <br/>

### Capstone Artifact #1 - Software Engineering and Design

In my first attempt at creating the application I was mainly focused on getting a usable application, and in doing so had left a lot to be desired especially regarding design. My application initially had three windows, and each had a dedicated function (logging weight, adding weight, and setting a target weight) with limited capacity. The application was strictly a user interface meant to store data and nothing else. The application functioned appropriately but I really disliked the color scheme, and while the layout was direct, I believed that it could have been improved upon. 

Once I had started this project I first set out to change the color scheme and design layout. I wanted the user to be able to visually track their progress, and make predictions, and use statistics to map their progress. To do this I needed to add new fragments and code to support<br/>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tweedleduh/tweedleduh.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
